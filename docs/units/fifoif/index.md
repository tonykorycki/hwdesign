# The Command-Response FIFO Interface

In the [simple scalar function example](../scalar_fun/), the IP interfaced with the processor via a set of simple
AXI-Lite command registers. This interface is inefficient because the processor must explicitly configure the IP
before each operation. When the processor is involved in many tasks, the delay in configuring the IP can be significant.
In addition, the interface we described requires periodically polling the IP, which also consumes significant overhead.

In this unit, we introduce a widely used and efficient design pattern for IPs: the **command–response** structure.

By working through this unit, you will learn to:
* Design **command** and **response** data structures for a simple IP
* Implement **FIFO** interfaces for the command and response data with **AXI-Stream** protocol
* Create VITIS-synthesizable **serialization** and **deserialization** methods for general data structures
* Add **transaction IDs** and **error controls** for command–response pairs
* Visualize the AXI-Stream protocols in timing diagrams
