# Simulating the Module

## Running the Simulation with the `xilinxutils` package
Once the testbench and module SV files are written, we run a **behavioral simulation**
to validate the functionality.  The simulation in Vivado is a bit complex, 
so I have inluded a function `sv_sim` in the `xilinxutils` package to run the simulation.
It can be used as follows:

* Open a terminal window in Linux or command prompt window in Windows
    * In Windows, do not use PowerShell.
* Follow the command to [set the path](../../support/amd/lauching.md) for the command-line utilities
* [Activate the virtual environment](../../support/repo/python.md) for `xilinxutils` package
* Run the command:
~~~bash
    (env) sv_sim --source simp_fun.sv --tb tb_simp_fun.sv
~~~ 

Running this command will run several Vivado command line utilities to simulate the
testbench.

## Running the Simulation Manually

The function `sv_sim` above is a python script I wrote as a wrapper around the Vivado tools
to perform all the steps necessary for simulation.
For this class, you can just use this function.  But, since the Vivado tool chain is constantly
changing, you may have to modify or write a new script yourself in the future.  
Also, you may want to modify
the script to add on other features.  So, it is useful to understand the sequence of steps the script performs.  When you call the function as above, the [script](https://github.com/sdrangan/hwdesign/blob/main/xilinxutils/scripts/sv_sim.py), performs the
following three functions:

- `xvlog -sv simp_fun.sv tb_simp_fun.sv`:
This command compiles (or *elaborates*) your SystemVerilog source files.
Vivado parses the HDL, checks for syntax errors, and builds an internal representation of the design.
The `-sv` option tells Vivado to use the SystemVerilog front‑end rather than the older Verilog‑2001 parser.
- `xelab tb_simp_fun -s tb_simp_fun_sim -log logs/xelab`:
This command elaborates the testbench into a runnable simulation snapshot.
Vivado resolves all module instantiations, parameters, and hierarchy, and then produces an executable simulation image named tb_simp_fun_sim.
You can think of this step as “linking” the compiled HDL into a simulator-ready binary.
- `xsim tb_simp_fun_sim -t run.tcl -log logs/xsim.log`:
This command actually runs the simulation.
The TCL script `run.tcl` provides the simulator with instructions such as how long to run, when to start and stop dumping waveforms, and when to exit.
It is also where the VCD file is opened and closed.


## Visualizing the Timing Diagram
Once the simulation is complete, it will create a **Value-Change Dump** or VCD file
with the trace of all the inputs.  You can then visualize that in [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sdrangan/hwdesign/blob/main/demos/basic_logic/timing_diag.ipynb).
