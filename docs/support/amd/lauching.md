# Launching Vitis and Vivado

## Vitis and Vivado Tools
Both Vitis and Vivado have various tools.  For Vitis, the tools we will use in the classs are:
- `vitis` — Launches the Vitis IDE or runs Vitis workflows from the command line.
- `vitis-run` — Builds and runs Vitis applications, including host code and hardware kernels.  We typically use a format of the form:
~~~bash
    vitis-run --mode hls --tcl <tclfile.tcl>
~~~

For Vivado, the tools are:
- `vivado` — Starts the Vivado IDE or runs synthesis/implementation scripts in batch mode.  
- `xvlog` — Compiles Verilog/SystemVerilog source files for simulation.
- `xelab` — Elaborates the compiled design and creates a simulation snapshot.
- `xsim` — Runs the simulation using the snapshot, with optional GUI or batch execution.

## Launching the Vitis or Vivado GUI in Windows

In Windows, you can run both the Vitis IDE and Vivado IDE from the **Start menu** by clicking the Windows button  and typing "Vivado" or "vitis" into the search bar.  Either operation is equivalent to running `vitis` or `vivado` from the command line.

## Setting the Path for Command Line Tools

To use any command line tool, you will need to set the path.
For a Vivado command line tool:

* In Windows, open a Command Shell, not a Powershell.  In Linux, open any terminal.
* Find the path the Vivado for the version you want to use:
    * On Linux, it is likely in `/tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2025.1`  
    * On Windows, is is likely in `c:\Xilinx\2025.1\Vivado`
* Run the settings command:
    * On Linux: `source <vivado_path>/settings64.sh`
    * On Windows: `<vivado_path>/settings64.bat` 
* You can now run a command like `vivado`.

The steps are similar for Vitis tools: 
* Determine where the vitis tool is located:
    * In Linux: `vitis` and `vitis-run` are typically located in a directory like `/tools/Xilinx/Vitis/2025.1`
    * In Windows: `vitis` and `vitis-run` are typically located in a directory like `c:\Xilinx\2025.1\Vitis`
* In that directory:
    * In Linux, run `source settings64.sh`
    * In Windows Command Shell (not Powershell), run: `settings64.bat` 
* Then, in the terminal run:
    * `vitis` for the Vitis GUI
    * `vitis-run --mode hls --tcl <tclfile.tcl>`
