# Submitting Problem Sets

## Overview

A small component of the course is based on problem sets with each unit.
These are not worth much of the overall grade, and you can any tool you want to solve 
the problems -- including AI and your friends.  Whatever helps you learn.
Just remember, you will need to be able to complete comparable problems on the midterm and final 
**without these aids**.  So, use the submission process as part of the learning process.

We are experimenting with an [AI-Autograder](../aiautograder/) for grading problem sets.
If successful, you will be able to get immediate, detailed feedback from an AI engine.
Follow the following steps to prepare and submit solutions.  Follow the [instructions](../aiautograder)
for submitting the solutions using the AI-autograder.

## Feedback, Please!  

Use of the AI's LLM for feedback is experimental, so I am not sure how well this work.  
We are entering a new era for teaching.  We would love to get your feedback.
