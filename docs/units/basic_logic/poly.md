# Using Multiple Stages

## A Polynomial Example

The simple function we started with could be computed in a single clock cycle
and easily meet timing.
In many cases, the function we need to compute takes multiple clock cycles.
To illustrate, consider implementing a quadratic function of the form:
~~~python
   y = w2*x*x + w1*x + w0
~~~
where the coefficients `w0`, `w1`, and `w2` are fixed and `x` is an input.
To make this simple, suppose that all the values are 16-bit signed integers
(so there is a chance of overflow).

This function may be hard to compute in a single clock cycle.  For example, we have to first
compute the square `x*x`, multiply it by `w2` and add it to the other terms.  So, in a single
clock cycle we would need to complete at least two multiplies and two additions.
The propagation delay may be too large.

## Dividing the Function over Multiple Stages

To implement this more complex function, we perform the operations 
over multiple **stages**.
This function is implemented in `hwdesign/demos/basic_logic/poly_fun.sv`.
Within this code, you can see three stages:

* Stage 0:  Register the input `x_s0 <= x`
* Stage 1:  Compute and register the square `xsq_s1 <=  x*x` and the linear term `w1_x_s1 <= w1*x`.
* Stage 2 (combinational):  Compute the output:  `y = w0*x + w1_x_s1 + w2`.
This output is not registered to avoid additional delay.

So, if the input `x` is valid in on the positive edge of clock cycle `n`, the output `y` is valid on the positive edge clock cycle `n+2`.  We say that the operation has a latency of 2.

## Running the Simulation

As in the [simple function example](./simulation.md), we can run simulate the module
with a testbench by opening a terminal, activating the virtual environment, and running:
~~~bash
    (env) sv_sim --source poly_fun.sv --tb tb_poly_fun.sv
~~~
This will generate a large directory `sim` with the simulation outputs including a file
`sim/dump.vcd` with the VCD traces.

## Viewing the Timing Diagram
Then, go to the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sdrangan/hwdesign/blob/main/demos/basic_logic/timing_diag.ipynb) to see the timing diagram:
