# Setting Up the Software

You will a few key pieces of software for this course:
* **Vitis HLS** used to design and simulate the hardware accelerators
in a simple C-like programming language
* **Vivado** used to create FPGA projects with the Vitis IP, processing system and peripherals
* **Python** that will run on processing system of the FPGA to connect and interact with the IP.
* **Course material**:  The course material and demos are maintained in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdrangan/fpgademos). 

This directory shows how to download the components, launch Vitis and Vivado,  build simple Vitis and Vivado projects.
