# Accessing the Vitis IP from PYNQ
We are now ready to access the Vitis IP from a jupyter notebook.

* Follow the [installation instructions](../hw_setup/index.md) to set-up the FPGA board, connect it to the host PC, and open a jupyter lab window.
* Copy the overlay files to the FPGA board processing system
   * You can do this by [cloning the repository](../sw_installation/repo.md) to the FPGA board
* On the host PC connected to the FPGA, open the notebook at `/fpgademos/scalar_adder/scalar_adder.ipynb`.
* The notebook is also at the [github page](https://github.com/sdrangan/fpgademos/tree/main/scalar_adder/notebooks/scalar_adder.ipynb)
