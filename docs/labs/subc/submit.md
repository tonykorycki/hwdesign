# Submitting the Lab

For NYU students that want to receive credit for the lab,
if you are running the Vitis and Vivado on your local machine, 
run the python command:

```bash
python submit.py
```

If you are running Vitis and Vivado on the [NYU machine](../../support/nyuremote/),
you should follow the [instructions](../../support/nyuremote/python.md) to set
up **uv** and then run the python command with the `uv` utility: 

```bash
uv run python submit.py
```

This program will look at the test vectors and validate that the tests have passed.
The program will create a zip file `submission.zip` with:

- `submitted_results.json`:  A JSON file with the test results
- `subc_divide.py`:  Your python implementation
- `subc_divide.sv`:  Your SV implementation
- `test_results/tv_python.csv` and `test_results/tv_sv.csv`:  The test vector files.

Submit this zip folder on Gradescope on the lab assignment.  A Gradescope autograder will upload the grade.
